## Blockchain Engineer Assignment 

### Usage

When developing the smart contracts i used the truffle suite of tools to help with the 
development and deployment of the contracts. 

you can download truffle

```bash
$ npm install -g truffle
```

to deploy the contracts I used `ganache` as my eth network and node emulator and 
it is also part of the truffle and suite and can be downloaded from the main truffle web page.


to deploy the smart contracts and execute the deployment script run in the root of the project:

```bash
$ truffle deploy
```

**Note: I used solc version 0.8.0 as my compiler**
